This server provides both unauthenticated (NTP) and authenticated (NTS) time services.
You are encouraged to use NTS where possible.

To enable NTS authentication, use the following line in your config file for either NTPsec or chrony:

```
server __THISHOST__ iburst nts
```

The nts flag at the end of the line indicates that the time from this server will only be used if it is properly authenticated.
